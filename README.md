### What I learned

I learned the importance of writing down comments on where I left off. I did not touch the challenge for two days due to school work and other projects. I got lost when I continued to work on it. I also learned how to put a background image behind all elements.

### Continued development

I submitted this solution without the mobile solution since I created this with the Mobile-First Workflow. I will continue it in the future by adding the other background image whenever the media query changes.
